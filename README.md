# AI in Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview

Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women worldwide, making early and accurate detection critically important. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques — including Deep Learning (DL) models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — to enhance breast cancer diagnosis. In addition, Explainable AI (XAI) methods are integrated to ensure transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness in predictions.

## Objectives

Develop AI models for early breast cancer detection using medical imaging.
Apply Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model predictions.
Evaluate model performance based on accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and AUC.
Bridge the gap between AI advancements and real-world clinical practice.
